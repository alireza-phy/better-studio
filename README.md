# to do list
this is a test project

version of node: 16.18.0
version of react: 18.2.0

After cloning the project, please run the "yarn" in the command line.

This project has been created without using the "create-react-app" command.
Tailwind CSS has been used for styling it.
The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using the "react-beautiful-dnd" package.
Webpack and Babel configurations have been set manually.

I had some problem by using the last edition of react-beautiful-dnd.
It seems that the new version of this package is not compatible with React and has some issues.
The result of my search on its GitHub and coding community also indicated that other programmers have experienced this issue.
I tried the suggested solutions, but they didn't work.
Also this package doesn't function correctly when strict mode is enabled.
finally, I used an older version one in this project and it worked.

thank you
